# Contributing
If you want to contribute to development of `elm_export` that is awesome.

There are a few ways you could help `elm_export`. Give feedback on your
experience. We would really like to make `elm_export` easy to use, so any
problems you encountered are interesting to me.

I am an non-native English speaker, so I bound to produce a lot spelling and
grammar mistakes. If you see one and know had to improve it, please create a
pull-request. 

Also take a look at the [issues][] to see if there is something you find
interesting.
